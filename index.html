    <h1>Killer Bunny</h1>
    <p>Don't be fooled by this little guy's cute exterior, this creature is incredibly dangerous.The killer bunny is carnivorous, and will not hesitate to attack and eat anything, including humans.</p>
    <p>They are often found in grassland, though occsasionally you'll find them in colder climates. Make sure to avoid their burrows or any caves they may be hiding in.</p>
    <p>Killer bunnies are most active just after sunrise, so be weary of them during those hours. Never wake one up; they are especially vicious when their sleep has been disturbed.</p>
